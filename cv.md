***A bit about myself***  
My goal is to learn JS well enough to start working as a Front-end developer by the beginning of autumn.    
I used to work as a Sales Manager which means:
> - I know how to __sell myself__ (I mean I know how to **do well** in an interview);
> - my **English level is high**;
> - I've got great **soft skills** (plus I _listen to people_ and I _hear them_);
> - I'm not afraid of **advancing my ideas**;
> - I'm able to **handle stress** (nothing is more stressful than sales, _imho_).

***Technologies and frameworks***   
Technologies that I use include **HTML, CSS, JavaScript**.
